<h1>My Projects</h1>
    <article>
        <P>I have worked on projects such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h2>Tri and Succeed Sports</h2></li>
                <img src="tss_logo.png" alt="" />
                <section>I have worked on Tri and Succeed Sports where I set up the font of their texts and the layout of their website. I was able use styling inorder to change the look of their font.
                    I also changed the positioning of images and texts.</section>
                <li><h2>Trusted Friends DayCare</h2></li>
                <img src="tf_logo.png" alt="" />
                <section>I Worked on Trusted Friends DayCare by learning how to style it for different platforms.  I learned how to set the screen width to differentiate between a mobile device, tablet and a computer.
                  The width of a mobile screen is typically 480 pixels at max so anything larger than that would be a tablet or a computer.</section>
                <li><h2>Slate & Pencil Tutoring</h2></li>
                <img src="slate and pencil_logo.png" alt="" />
                <section>For Slate & Pencil Tutoring I worked on making a grid for each item to be placed in allowing for a smoother looking website.  I used a grid inorder to assign the pictures and the text in the right position and orientation.
                    This allowed me to make the site smoother beceause nothing was overlapping.
